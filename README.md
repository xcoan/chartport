MedLog-API service

This is a project developed in Ruby on Rails 5 for ArchHacks 2016.

The concept of MedLog is for healthcare professionals to have easy access to patient records.

The records can be easily updated and maintained.  They are also easily exported for potential use
in in-house creations of hospital IT departments, or to transfer from one medical database to another.
