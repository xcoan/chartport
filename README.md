"MedLog Service" (WIP name)

### What is it?
In short, MedLog exists as a cloud-based service for healthcare professionals to have easy access to patient records.

Planned features include the ability for records to easily be transferred between healthcare facilities, records being exported for internal user, and the ability to prescribe mediations to patients and send those prescriptions to a chosen pharmacy.

### Development
This project was originally created at [ArchHacks](http://archhacks.io/) in November 2016.
It is currently being further revised and edited for the [GE Health Cloud Innovation Challenge](http://gehealthcloud.devpost.com).

A page style guide (for front-end/view development) can be found [here](/app/views/readme.md).
