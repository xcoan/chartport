### Development History
This project was originally created at [ArchHacks](http://archhacks.io/) in November 2016.
It is currently being further revised and edited for the [GE Health Cloud Innovation Challenge](http://gehealthcloud.devpost.com).

Development uses postgresql as it's database, so be sure you have postgres installed locally when setting up an environment.


### Features
* User Accounts - Support for both doctors and system administrators.
* Patient Records - Patients "belong" to a doctor in the system, but can be transferred easily to other doctors.  Only the current doctor may edit patient information.
* Patient Notes - Records entered by a doctor about the patient, appearing on the patient's record in ChartPort.
* Prescriptions and Medications - Doctors can add prescriptions to patient records.
* Hospitals - ChartPort includes support to show registered hospitals or other medical facilities.  Each page includes Google Maps Geolocation support.
* Hospital Registrations - Doctor accounts can "register" to any hospital they practice at.  Registrations can be viewed from the Doctor's page.  A list of registrations per hospital can be seen at the hospital's record page.
* Encryption - Data contained within ChartPort is encrypted.

### How to download/install for development
Make sure you have RVM, Ruby, and Ruby Gems installed.
You will also need postgres installed.

Git clone the app, cd into the directory, then run `bundle`.

Next, set up the database: `bundle exec rake db:create`.
Migrate the database: `bundle exec rake db:migrate`.

Finally, to run over localhost, run `rails server`.
Navigate to `localhost:3000` to see the app in your browser.
