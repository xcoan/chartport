#Style Guide
Currently, [Medlog](http://github.com/xcoan/medlog) makes extensive use of [Bootstrap](http://http://getbootstrap.com/).

These are just some guidelines to make Medlog pages look standardized.

## General
All pages (with the exception of views form the Pages_Controller) are styled using `<div class="container">`

From there, pages begin with a `<div class="jumbotron">`, followd by `<h1></h1>` of a generic title or theme the page follows. E.g. "Edit Hospital".

After the jumbotron, `<div class="page-header">` should be used to introduce new topics per page.  Inside the page header there should be a `<h2>` tag containing the theme of the content.
